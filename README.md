# Analyzing-the-Performance-Efficiency-of-The-Radisson-Hotels-using-Data-Visualization-TechniqProject Description:
Report:
The hotel industry is a broad category of businesses that provide lodging services for travellers and tourists. This can include a wide range of establishments, from luxury resorts to budget-friendly motels, as well as extended stay hotels, boutique hotels, and more. Hotels can be found in nearly every corner of the world, and are often a major component of the tourism and travel industry in a given area.

Radisson owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 100 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Radisson is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Radisson wanted to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence in order to regain their market share and revenue. Our task is to create an analytics dashboard & story to provide them insights to make better business decisions.
